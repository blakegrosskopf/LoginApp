#Mobile Login Application

This project is a mobile login application built using Python and Kivy, with SQLite3 as the database solution. The primary goal of this project is to progressively enhance security features over time, making it a continually evolving and improving application.

Current Features (Version 1.0)

A simple login screen that allows users to register and log in.

Password validation that ensures the password meets specific criteria (e.g., uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, and minimum length).

SQLite3 database for secure storage of user credentials.

Future Goals

Implementing additional security measures, such as password hashing and salting.

Adding two-factor authentication (2FA).

Implementing account lockout mechanisms for multiple failed attempts.

Encrypting stored data for enhanced security.

Performing penetration testing to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.

Motivation

This project serves as a progressive learning experience, aiming to explore and strengthen security concepts. The plan is to continuously refine the application by attempting self-penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and apply improvements.

Technologies Used
